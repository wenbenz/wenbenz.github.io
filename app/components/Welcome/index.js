                        <h4>Hi!</h4>
                        <p>
                            I'm Ben, I have a Bachelor's of Computer Science (Co-op) from the University of Waterloo. I'm currently working full time at Okta building mission critical services that many other teams depend on. You can find my resume <a href="files/resume.pdf">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What can I do?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my academic and professional career, I have gained experience working with a plethora of different languages, frameworks, paradigms, and technologies. Consequently, I can work in any modern development environment. I'm capable of quickly adapting and learning new technologies to work with your company's existing code and tackling any challenges.
                        </p>

                        <h4>So what am I like?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I would describe myself as an active and social person. In my free time I dance, rock climb, hike, swim, and skate. I also enjoy boardgames, Dungeons and Dragons, and generally just hanging out with people. Iâ€™m an open-minded individual and I love trying new things :)
